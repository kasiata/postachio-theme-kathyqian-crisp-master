# Crisp

Crisp is a wonderful little theme, originally created to work with [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org). I don't use Ghost so I ported [Kathy](http://kathyqian.com/)'s theme to work with [Postach.io](http://postach.io). I hope she doesn't mind. It is her theme and she deserves all the credit. I tried to stay true to her original vision.

[The original](https://github.com/kathyqian/crisp-ghost-theme) can be downloaded from GitHub but it's designed to work with Ghost, so be forewarned.
